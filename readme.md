# Portfolio-Website: Project Documentation
Project Purpose
This site acts as the "digital centerpiece" of the work I produce. We have:
1. Technical Work (Projects Page): Highlighting the technical projects which are up on GitHub.
2. Creative Work (Atelier Page): Highlighting the pursuit of visual artistry and mastery thereof.

Roadmap
- [x] Sitemap
- [x] Branding
- [x] Site MVP
- [ ] Feature Development and Polishing

- [ ] Success Tracking
Due to the nature of the Personal Portfolio this project will be ongoing. Hopping between features, polishing and branding as the months go by. The true success of this project will lie in updating the site every quarter (3-months) or so.
